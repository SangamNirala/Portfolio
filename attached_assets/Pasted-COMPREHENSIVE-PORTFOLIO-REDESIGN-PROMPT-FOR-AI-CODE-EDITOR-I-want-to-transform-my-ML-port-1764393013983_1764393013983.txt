COMPREHENSIVE PORTFOLIO REDESIGN PROMPT FOR AI CODE EDITOR:

---

I want to transform my ML portfolio into a world-class, high-converting design. 
Please implement these UI/UX enhancements:

### SECTION 1: INTERACTIVE PROJECT CARDS
- Add hover effects: cards scale 1.05x with smooth transition
- On hover, display "View Code" (GitHub) and "Live Demo" buttons with glassmorphic overlay
- Overlay should have: backdrop-filter blur(10px), semi-transparent background (rgba(255,255,255,0.05))
- Add project metrics prominently at top (e.g., "96.5% Accuracy", "92.4% Retrieval Rate")
- Metrics displayed as colored badges with icons
- Add deployment info (Flask, Streamlit, etc.)
- All animations should be 300-500ms with smooth easing

### SECTION 2: GLASSMORPHISM EFFECTS (2025 TREND)
- Apply glassmorphic effects to:
  * Hero section background (behind text area)
  * Experience timeline cards (subtle glass effect)
  * Project card overlays on hover
  * Skills tier containers (Expert/Intermediate/Familiar sections)
- Use: backdrop-filter: blur(10px), background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05), border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)

### SECTION 3: MICRO-INTERACTIONS & ANIMATIONS
- All buttons: Add ripple effect on click + 300ms scale animation
- Section headings: Fade-in + slide-up animation when scrolling into view (600ms)
- Skill tags: Staggered entrance animation (each tag delayed 50ms, 400ms duration per tag)
- Achievement cards: Gentle bounce animation on scroll (500ms)
- Links: Underline animation + subtle glow on hover (250ms)
- Timeline dots: Continuous pulse animation (2-second loop)

### SECTION 4: PROGRESS BAR & NAVIGATION
- Add horizontal progress bar at top of page showing scroll position
- Progress bar should fill from left to right as user scrolls
- Navigation items: Active section should have animated underline
- Implement smooth scroll-to-section when navigation clicked

### SECTION 5: ABOUT SECTION REDESIGN
Replace generic text with:
"🎯 Impact-Driven ML Engineer | 2 Internships | Production Deployments
I build production-grade ML systems that drive real business results:
✓ Deployed real-time LSTM model serving 92.4% accuracy
✓ Increased sales by 40% through AI automation workflows
✓ Full-stack ML engineer (deep learning → deployment → scaling)"
Remove "aspiring" - emphasize actual achievements

### SECTION 6: ENHANCED SKILLS DISPLAY
Reorganize skills into three tiers with visual indicators:
- Expert (5 stars): Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Flask, ML Pipelines
- Intermediate (4 stars): JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Docker, GCP, NLP, LangChain
- Familiar (2 stars): FastAPI, Streamlit, Keras, Jenkins, Scikit-learn, DVC
Add small badge showing number of projects using each skill

### SECTION 7: FOOTER ENHANCEMENTS
- Add newsletter signup form: "Get ML & AI insights delivered monthly"
- Add social media icons with hover animations:
  * LinkedIn: Scale 1.1x + border glow on hover
  * GitHub: Scale 1.1x + background color change
  * Email: Scale 1.1x + icon color change
- Add quick stats: "© 2025 Sangam Nirala"
- Add optional: "Latest Article" section if you write technical blogs

### SECTION 8: BENTO BOX STATS SECTION
Create a "Quick Stats" section with 2x3 grid:
Row 1: [Projects: 2] [Code Lines: 5000+] [Companies: 2]
Row 2: [Languages: 4] [Frameworks: 8] [Deployed: Yes]
Each stat box should have a unique icon and subtle gradient background

### SECTION 9: PROJECT FILTERING
- Add filter buttons above project cards: [All] [ML Models] [Web Apps] [Deployment]
- Implement smooth filter transitions (fade out old, fade in new)
- Show filtered count: "Showing X of 2 projects"

### SECTION 10: TIMELINE INTERACTIVITY
- Timeline dots: Add hover effects (scale 1.2x + glow)
- Timeline line: Add gradient coloring (blue → teal)
- Timeline dots: Make clickable to scroll to that experience
- On hover, show tooltip with: [Company Name] [Duration] [Location]

### SECTION 11: MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
- Hamburger menu for navigation (visible on screens < 768px)
- Stack all buttons full-width on mobile
- Timeline: Vertical layout with dots on left side
- Hero section: Profile pic stacked above text on mobile
- Minimum touch target size: 48px height
- Optimized font sizes for mobile readability

### SECTION 12: ACCESSIBILITY & POLISH
- Ensure WCAG AA color contrast compliance
- Add alt text to all images/icons
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Add loading animations/skeleton screens for project cards
- Add accessibility badges at bottom: "WCAG AA | Mobile Responsive | Lighthouse 95+"

### SECTION 13: ANIMATIONS SPECIFICATIONS
Keep animation durations consistent:
- Button interactions: 200-300ms
- Section transitions: 400-600ms
- Hover effects: 250-350ms
- Loading animations: 2-3 seconds
Use ease-in-out or cubic-bezier for natural feeling

### ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain dark theme with blue accents (current color scheme is good)
- Add subtle background motion/parallax if performance allows
- Ensure all animations can be disabled via prefers-reduced-motion
- Test responsiveness on mobile (320px, 480px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
- Performance: Keep Lighthouse score > 90
- All links should have visual feedback (hover state)
